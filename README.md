# Penalty-regressions

This repository contains the results and technical aspects  of the Data Science Core IP "As a Data Scientist, you work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.


### Approach 1: Linear regression
### Approach 2: Quantile regression
### Approach 3: Ridge regression
### Approach 4: Lasso regression
### Approach 5: Elastic Net regression

We will compare the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE's) for the above models and rank them on how they perform. We will further challenge our solutions with feature extraction and rerun the same regressions and finally challenge all the solutions with polynomial regression.


## Getting Started

## Overview

This repository contains the technical aspects of Data Science Core IP submission week 7 as outlined above. The project applies the regression techniques learnt as well as feature engineering, cross validation, heteroskedasticity test.
